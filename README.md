# Nginx Module: extended_status

This module provides additional status information by extending the build-in 
Nginx `status` module with finer details.

*Note: This module is not distributed with the Nginx source. Details on 
installation, including patching the Nginx source and compiling Nginx with this 
module, as well as configuration instructions and examples, can be found below.*

# Installation

Installation of this module requires applying a patch to the Nginx core source-
source. As this source-code changes with each release, there are *specific patch
files* provided for various versions of Nginx.

- [`0.8.54` and `0.8.55`](extended_status-0.8.54.patch)
- [`1.0.11`](extended_status-1.0.11.patch)
- [`1.4.2`](extended_status-1.4.2.patch)
- [`1.5.2`](extended_status-1.5.2.patch)
- [`1.6.2`](extended_status-1.6.2.patch)
- [`1.7.8`](extended_status-1.7.8.patch)
- [`1.7.10`](extended_status-1.7.10.patch)

### Patching the Nginx source

To ready the Nginx source-code, choose the `*.patch` file that corresponds with
the version of Nginx you are trying to compile. Next, run the following patch
command (replacing `x.x.x` with the correct version string):

```
patch -p1 < extended_status-x.x.x.patch
```

As an example, to patch Nginx `0.8.54`/`0.8.55`, `1.0.11`, or `1.7.10`, you 
would run one of the following commands, respectively:

```
patch -p1 < extended_status-0.8.54.patch
patch -p1 < extended_status-1.0.11.patch
patch -p1 < extended_status-1.7.10.patch
```

Be sure to review the output of the `patch` command and verify it was successful.
Generally, if it encounters an error it will inform you by providing the specific
block(s) within the patch it could not successfully apply.

### Compilation

*Before proceeding with this step, be sure you applied the appropriate patch per
the above instructions. If you are attempting to compile an unsupported version
of Nginx, see the below guide creating a new patch.*

To compile Nginx, run the following set of commands. You must replace the
directory path in the `./configure` line, after `--add-module=`, to point to the
location of this source code. Running `make` performs the actual compilation and
running `make install` installs the compiled files to your system.

```
./configure --add-module=dir/path/to/nginx_extended_status_module
make
make install
```

*Note: It is likely you will want to configure additional aspects of Nginx.
Running `./configure --help` will provide you with a list of available options
to further customize the build process.*

### Patching unsupported versions

If you are attempting to use this module with a version of Nginx that does not
have a pre-made `patch` file, it is suggest you proceed as follows.

- Determine the closest matching patch file available (for example, if you 
  wanted to compile this module against Nginx 1.7.6, you would choose the 
  [1.7.8](extended_status-1.7.8.patch) patch file).
- Attempt to apply the patch per the above instructions.
- If the patch operation *does not succeed* and outputs errors about being
  unable to apply specific blocks of the patch file:
  - Create a copy of the patch file you started with (named appropriately for
    the version of Nginx you are trying to compile).
  - Review the source code and patch file to determine the required changes.
  - Update the patch file and re-attempt to apply it once you believe you have 
    satisfied any errors.
- Otherwise, if the patch operation *succeeds without error*:
  - It is possible the patch is valid against your version of Nginx.
  - It is recommended you verify the results of the patch by looking over the 
    resulting Nginx source code.
- Perform the installation as described below and verify Nginx both *compiles* 
  and *runs*, and that the *module behaves as expected*.

*Please: If you take the time to do this, please either submit an issue stating
that a specific patch properly worked with a version of Nginx not listed or
submit a pull request with the new patch file so others can benefit from your
effort.*

## Configuration

This module allows for one Nginx configuration directive: `extended_status`. It
can be set to either *on* or *off*, defaulting to *off*. It is valid in the
*http*, *server*, and *location* Nginx configuration contexts.

### Definition

- *Syntax*: `extended_status on|off;`
- *Default state*: `off`
- *Valid contexts*: `http`, `server`, `location`

### Working example

```
location = /extended_status {
  extended_status on;
}
location = /tablesort.min.js {
  root html;
}
```
